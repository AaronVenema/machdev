        <Segment>Oh, we're welllll past that, Jerry! A price for everything. My appearance is designed to be familiar and to put you at ease. Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.

And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it. There's a lesson here and I'm not going to be the one to figure it out. Your special time is your power. It makes you strong like a boob. Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough!

It's fine, everythings is fine. theres an infinite number of realities Morty, and in a few dozens of those i got lucky and turned everything back to normal. Lookin' good! Summer, next time we're hiding in a chlorkian echo nest, can you do me a favour and turn your ringer off?! Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh yeah you can't. They blew up.

I'm your worst nightmare, bitch! Wow, so your origin is what? You fell into a vat of redundancy? Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it. Looossseeerrrrr.</Segment>
